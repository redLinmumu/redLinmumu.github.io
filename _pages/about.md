My research interest includes optimal transport and multi-modal alignment. I am currently   a Ph.D. student at the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Hongteng Xu](https://hongtengxu.github.io/). 
I pursued my master's degree at the School of Automation, [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xuemei Ren](https://pure.bit.edu.cn/en/persons/xuemei-ren).
